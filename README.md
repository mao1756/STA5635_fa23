|11|Principal Component Analysis|TBD/9|
|12|Reinforcement Learning|TBD/9|

(*1): I made a minor error calculating the loss. I should have taken the average of the losses across all the batches, but in my code, I only recorded the loss of the last batch.
(*2): The grader mentioned that I need to plot contingency matrices before the relabeling. (I don't agree since the wording in the HW statement does not mention this)
